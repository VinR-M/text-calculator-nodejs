## Sum of Numbers

CLI application that takes a sum as a string in either digits, spanish or english and returns its result as string in the same language (digits/spanish/english).

The string will be two numbers and an infix operator (+/mas/plus).

Max number is 999 and min number is 0.

The entry point of the CLI is the file `calculate`. This file already already exists in the repository but implementation is missing.
